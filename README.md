## Description

Welcome to "The Maze" - a thrilling adventure game where you must navigate your way through a treacherous maze filled with twists, turns, and challenges at every corner.

As the game begins, you find yourself trapped in a mysterious and seemingly endless labyrinth, with only your wits and instincts to guide you. Your ultimate goal is to find your way out of the maze and escape to freedom.

But it won't be easy. Along the way, you'll encounter obstacles such as locked doors, hidden traps, and even dangerous creatures lurking in the shadows. You'll need to use your problem-solving skills and quick reflexes to overcome these challenges and move closer to your goal.

As you progress through the maze, you'll collect valuable items and power-ups that will aid you in your quest. But be careful - some items may have unexpected consequences, and some power-ups may not be what they seem.

"The Maze" is a game of skill, strategy, and adventure, where every decision you make could mean the difference between success and failure. Will you have what it takes to conquer the maze and emerge victorious? Only time will tell.

> I'm going to make the game multiplayer, to introduce the surprise factor and if the player does meet another player, he can write something in chat, but any message will turn into incomprehensible characters, this and other design solutions should help immerse the player in the world so that he did not expect to see on the map similar player and he will long doubt whether it is a real player or not. I also want to create an eerie ambiance, since the levels resemble the Backrooms.
